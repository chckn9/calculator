A simple calculator project:

* It is still very buggy and can only perform very basic functions
* This is mainly to practice my JavaScript so the code is rather messy

Issues:
- Doesn't support leading negative numbers
- No validation for number of decimals + negatives
- Calculations will be wrong if equal sign is pressed
  and calculations are continued (must clear)
- Fix keydown for backspace/clear
- Others...
